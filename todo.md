# TODO
- Implement variables which may be unbounded (i.e. -inf).
- Implement callback for lazily adding constraints - for instance adding DFJ (subtour elimination) constraints to TSP.
- Implement a time budget for the solver.
- Implement support for unbounded variables.
- Implement support for variables on the RHS of constraints.
