# TODO
- [x] Implement best-bound node selection
- [-] Implement strong branching
- [ ] Implement pseudo-cost branching
- [ ] Implement variables which may be unbounded (i.e. -inf).
- [ ] Implement callback for lazily adding constraints - for instance adding DFJ (subtour elimination) constraints to TSP.
- [ ] Implement a time budget for the solver.
- [ ] Implement support for variables on the RHS of constraints.
- [ ] Move directly to HiGHS isntead of working through the scipy wrapper.
